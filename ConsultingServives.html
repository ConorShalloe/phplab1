       <p>The Blockchain is a hot topic for discussion -  it has the potential to revolutionise domestic and international transactions - but of course also comes with its disadvantages.
           The Blockchain was invented in the context of the digital currency, Bitcoin (which by now, most people have heard of). The Blockchain is a public ledger of all the Bitcoin transactions, which  continues to grow exponentially. Blockchain allows parties to transact securely in the absence of a third party intermediary and it is clear that some businesses recognise the potential savings connected to Blockchain or other distributed ledger technology.</p>
