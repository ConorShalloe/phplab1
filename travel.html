        <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:verdana">I have been lucky enough to have had the chance to visit many different countries since I was young. Every Summer I used to go on holidays with my family for a couple of weeks. We usually went to either France, Spain and Portugal and I enjoyed these trips immensely.
         <br></br>
            I was also fortunate enough to have had the chance to go skiing on a couple of occasions. When I was 11 years old I went skiing for a week in Andorra with my family and then in transition year I had the chance to go skiing in Lillehammer in Norway. This was my first chance to go away with my friends as opposed to my family and I really enjoyed it. The next chance I got to do this was after the Leaving Cert. I went away with eleven of my friends for 10 days. We went to Prague in Czech Republic for 5 days and then Benicassim in Spain for 5 days. Some of my fondest memories are from this holiday and I enjoyed every minute of it. Iâ€™m going away this Summer again with my friends to the island of Ios in Greece. I am very much looking forward to this and to the chance to travel more in the future.</p>
